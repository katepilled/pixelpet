# pixipet

## Overview
pixipet is a web application inspired by the classic Tamagotchi children's game. Users are able to take on the role of a pet owner and nurture their own pixiet -- a virtual pet that users can feed, play with,
and clean. Each pixipet comes hatched from an egg, and based on the user's care, can grow and thrive.


## Data Model

The application will store Users and Pets.
** each user has 1 pet via reference

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "petlover",
  hash: // a password hash,
  pet: // reference to Pet document
}
```

An Example Pet:

```javascript
{
  name: "Breakfast foods",
  owner: // reference to User document
  age: // Number of days since created
  happiness_level: 90  // Number out of 100
  hunger_level: 10  // Number out of 100
  cleanliness:  100  // Number out of 100

}
```

(__TODO__: create a first draft of your Schemas in db.mjs and link to it)

## Wireframes

(__TODO__: wireframes for all of the pages on your site; they can be as simple as photos of drawings or you can use a tool like Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, etc.)

/list/create - page for creating a new shopping list

![list create](documentation/list-create.png)

/list - page for showing all shopping lists

![list](documentation/list.png)

/list/slug - page for showing specific shopping list

![list](documentation/list-slug.png)

## Site map

(__TODO__: draw out a site map that shows how pages are related to each other)

Here's a [complex example from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Sitemap_google.jpg), but you can create one without the screenshots, drop shadows, etc. ... just names of pages and where they flow to.

## User Stories or Use Cases

(__TODO__: write out how your application will be used through [user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Format) and / or [use cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case))

1. as non-registered user, I can register a new account with the site
2. as a user, I can log in to the site
3. as a user, I can create a new grocery list
4. as a user, I can view all of the grocery lists I've created in a single list
5. as a user, I can add items to an existing grocery list
6. as a user, I can cross off items in an existing grocery list

## Research Topics

(__TODO__: the research topics that you're planning on working on along with their point values... and the total points of research topics listed)

* (5 points) Integrate user authentication
    * I'm going to be using passport for user authentication
    * And account has been made for testing; I'll email you the password
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/register</code> for register page
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/login</code> for login page
* (4 points) Perform client side form validation using a JavaScript library
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/my-form</code>
    * if you put in a number that's greater than 5, an error message will appear in the dom
* (5 points) vue.js
    * used vue.js as the frontend framework; it's a challenging library to learn, so I've assigned it 5 points

10 points total out of 8 required points (___TODO__: addtional points will __not__ count for extra credit)


## [Link to Initial Main Project File](app.mjs) 

(__TODO__: create a skeleton Express application with a package.json, app.mjs, views folder, etc. ... and link to your initial app.mjs)

## Annotations / References Used

(__TODO__: list any tutorials/references/etc. that you've based your code off of)

1. [passport.js authentication docs](http://passportjs.org/docs) - (add link to source code that was based on this)
2. [tutorial on vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) - (add link to source code that was based on this)
