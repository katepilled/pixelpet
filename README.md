# pixelpet

pixelpet is a web application inspired by the classic Tamagotchi children's game. Users are able to take on the role of a pet owner and nurture their own pixelpet -- a virtual pet that users can feed, play with, and clean. Each pixelpet comes hatched from an egg, and based on the user's care, can grow and thrive. In the future, I'd like to add pet animations, more sophisticated pet care, the option for a game over, and the ability to add friends and view their pets.
